## HOW WRITE FUNCTIONS? 

what is programming? 

implementing algorithms, do step by step, instructions

Algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to 
perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations,
data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
