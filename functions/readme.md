# functions

## function definitions 
Function is:
* a statement or group of statements that together perform a task.
* usually take data, process it, and return a result.  
* the simpler tool for programmers to write [clean code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).

The clean code is code:
* easy to understand.
* easy to modify.
* easy to test.
* works correctly.

functions vs algorithms

Algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to 
perform a computation.
Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations,
data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
